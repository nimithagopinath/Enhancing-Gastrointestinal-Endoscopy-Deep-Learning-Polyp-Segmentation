# Enhancing-Gastrointestinal-Endoscopy-Deep-Learning-Polyp-Segmentation


Colorectal polyps are abnormal tissue growths that extend into the intestines, specifically the colon, and rectum. They can be categorized into noncancerous and cancerous types. Noncancerous polyps, if left untreated, have the potential to progress into cancerous growths, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Colonoscopy serves as the gold standard procedure for identifying, localizing, and removing colorectal polyps. However, due to the variability in polyp shape, size, and the similarity of surrounding tissues, polyps can be missed during colonoscopy. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis systems leveraging deep learning techniques have been developed to reduce the miss rate. Semantic segmentation, an approach that labels each pixel of an image with its corresponding class, has emerged as a promising method. In this project, we develop a simple UNet architecture and compare its performance with a modified UNet architecture that incorporates a pre-trained ResNet50 as the encoder for improved polyp segmentation. The project focuses on training and evaluating two semantic segmentation architectures: a simple UNet architecture and a modified UNet architecture with a pre-trained ResNet50 model as the encoder. The UNet architecture, renowned for its encoder-decoder structure, effectively captures high-level and low-level features, making it a popular choice for semantic segmentation tasks. The modified UNet architecture enhances the UNet by integrating a pre-trained ResNet50 model, enabling it to extract more intricate features from input images. Transfer learning is employed, capitalizing on the ResNet50 model's pretraining on a large-scale dataset, to enhance polyp segmentation accuracy. To ensure the validity and generalizability of the developed models, we utilize the CVC-ClinicDB dataset, the official database used in the MICCAI 2015 Sub-Challenge on Automatic Polyp Detection Challenge in Colonoscopy Videos. The training process involves feeding the images into the UNet and modified UNet architectures, followed by loss calculation and gradient-based optimization to update the model weights. During the evaluation, various quantitative metrics, including pixel-wise accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are computed to assess their performance. Additionally, qualitative visual comparisons are conducted to evaluate the visual quality and segmentation accuracy of the detected polyps. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two architectures in accurately segmenting polyps. The modified UNet architecture with pre-trained ResNet50 achieves higher accuracy compared to the simple UNet architecture, highlighting the benefits of leveraging pre-trained models. The research outcomes contribute to advanced computer-aided diagnosis systems, enabling early detection and intervention in colorectal polyps. Accurate and efficient polyp segmentation algorithms reduce time and costs, optimizing resource allocation for timely patient interventions. These developed models offer promising and practical tools for automated polyp segmentation in clinical settings. Further research, including dataset expansion and incorporation of additional annotated data, can further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the models
